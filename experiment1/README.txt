The objective of this experiment is to confirm that a performance hit can be attained, and the steps to do so are outlined below:

1. Use the assignment's compiling command to compile alias_experiment.c.
2. Execute the experiment 20 times for addresses that are aliased.
3. Execute the experiment 20 times for addresses that are not aliased.
4. Output the average runtime and perf results to the console.

To initiate the experiment, run the command python3 script.py.
