The objective of this experiment is to confirm that a time-channel attack is possible to get a victim`s secret offset:

1. Use the assignment's compiling command to compile offset_scan.
2. Scan all possible offsets (4096) relaying on the hit penalty received of the false dependancy.
3. Average results and return the highest latency offset.

a util script is added to plot the results
